This is a private, difficulty 1, testnet-in-a-box for [Litecoin](https://litecoin.info/) - based off [freewil's testnet-box](http://github.com/freewil/bitcoin-testnet-box) for bitcoin.

Use it as follows:

    $ make start

This will start two nodes. You need two because otherwise the node won't
generate blocks. You now have a private testnet:

    $ make getinfo
    litecoind -datadir=1  getinfo
    {
        "version" : 60300,
        "protocolversion" : 60001,
        "walletversion" : 60000,
        "balance" : 0.00000000,
        "blocks" : 0,
        "connections" : 1,
        "proxy" : "",
        "difficulty" : 0.00024414,
        "testnet" : true,
        "keypoololdest" : 1367704943,
        "keypoolsize" : 101,
        "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
        "mininput" : 0.00010000,
        "errors" : ""
    }
    
    litecoind -datadir=2  getinfo
    {
        "version" : 60300,
        "protocolversion" : 60001,
        "walletversion" : 60000,
        "balance" : 0.00000000,
        "blocks" : 0,
        "connections" : 1,
        "proxy" : "",
        "difficulty" : 0.00024414,
        "testnet" : true,
        "keypoololdest" : 1367704943,
        "keypoolsize" : 101,
        "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
        "mininput" : 0.00010000,
        "errors" : ""
    }


To start generating blocks:

    $ make generate-true
  
To stop generating blocks:

    $ make generate-false

OR, point your mining software at the address of the test machine, port 19334 (Server 1) using the username `testnet` and the password `myAmazingRPCPassword`. With a decent GPU, you should find a new block every second or so initially. If you continue to mine, the difficulty of the network will adjust to your miner.

To get the address the mined coins will end up in, run:

    $ make getaccountaddress

That will query just the first node, as that is the one receiving the mining rewards.

# Mining with `cgminer`
Using the command (if you are running the testnet on the same box as the miner - otherwise change 127.0.0.1 to the address of the testnet)

    ./cgminer --scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:19334 -O testnet:testnet --shaders 2048 --thread-concurrency 8192 -w 256 -g2 -I 13 --auto-gpu --temp-overheat 81 --gpu-vddc 1.030 --temp-cutoff 97 --gpu-fan=100 --gpu-engine 700-1000 --gpu-memclock 1500

Change `127.0.0.1` in the command to the IP of the testnet box if not running on the same server. You should see output like:

To stop the two nodes:
  
    $ make stop
  
To clean up any files created while running the testnet 
(and restore to the original state)

    $ make clean

Like all testnet nodes, it is listening on port 19333.
The secondary node is listening for RPC connections on port 19343 (but it will not accept connections from other P2P nodes).

When running & generating coin - remember that you'll need the coins to mature before you can use them in a transaction.
